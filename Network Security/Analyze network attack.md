# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Analyze Network Attacks

## Scenario

You work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. The employees of the company regularly access the company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages their customers might like. 

One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. You attempt to visit the company’s website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser.

You use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. You notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. You suspect the server is under attack by a malicious actor. 

You take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. You also configure the company’s firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. You know that your IP blocking solution won’t last long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block. You need to alert your manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. You will need to be prepared to tell your boss about the type of attack you discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees.

## Identify the Type of Attack That May Have Caused This Network Interruption 
* One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is: DOS attack <br>
* The logs show that:  Web server stops responding after receiving so many SYN packet requests <br>
* This event could be: Syn flood attack

## Part 2: Explain How the Attack is Causing the Website Malfunction 
When website visitors try to establish a connection with the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol. Explain the three steps of the handshake: 

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | `SYN` : Client sends SYN packet to the server, requesting a connection. |
| 2 | `SYN/ACK` : Server responds with SYN/ACK packet, acknowledging the client's SYN and requesting confirmation of the connection. |
| 3 | `ACK` : Client sends ACK packet to the server, acknowledging the server's SYN/ACK. |

* `Explain what happens when a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets all at once:` When a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets all at once, it overwhelms the target server's resources, leading to a situation called a SYN flood attack. This results in the server being unable to respond to legitimate connection requests, causing service disruption or denial of service. <br>

* `Explain what the logs indicate and how that affects the server:` The logs indicate a large influx of TCP SYN requests from an unfamiliar IP address, suggesting a potential SYN flood attack. This influx overwhelms the server's resources, causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate connection requests and potentially leading to service degradation or downtime.
