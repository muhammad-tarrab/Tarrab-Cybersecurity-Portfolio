# NIST Framework for Security Incident Response

## Scenario 

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.
During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 
The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 
To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 
A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics
As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity incident and integrate your analysis into a general security strategy:

1. Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 
2. Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 
3. Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 
4. Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 
5. Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.

### Incident Summary

The organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, specifically an ICMP/ping flood, resulting in the unresponsiveness of network services. This attack was facilitated by a flood of ICMP packets sent to the organization's network, overwhelming its capacity and causing disruption. In response, the incident management team swiftly acted to block the flood attack and temporarily shut down non-critical network services to mitigate the impact. The incident highlights the importance of proactive measures to defend against DDoS attacks and ensure the availability and reliability of network resources.

|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identification**    | - The ICMP flood attack targeted the company's internal network, impacting a range of systems and devices within the network infrastructure. Pinpointing the specific affected systems and devices is crucial for targeted remediation efforts.                    |
|                     | - Business processes reliant on network connectivity, such as communication systems, data transfer, and access to shared resources, were disrupted by the attack. Identifying these affected processes is essential for prioritizing restoration efforts and minimizing operational downtime. |
|                     | - IT personnel responsible for remediation, network administrators overseeing system maintenance, and employees dependent on network resources for their daily tasks require access to the affected systems to address the impact and restore normal operations swiftly.                            |
| **Protect**           | - **Access controls:** Determine who requires access to the affected items and establish measures to restrict access from non-trusted sources. <br> - **Awareness/Training:** Educate relevant personnel about the attack and provide training on preventive measures to mitigate future occurrences. <br> - **Data security:** Identify any affected data and implement measures to enhance its security. Review and update information protection procedures to safeguard data assets. <br> - **Maintenance:** Assess if any affected hardware, operating systems, or software require updates to patch vulnerabilities exploited in the attack. <br> - **Protective Technology:** Evaluate and deploy protective technologies such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to fortify defenses against future attacks. Continuous monitoring and updates are essential to adapt to evolving threats. |
| **Detect**           | - **Anomalies and events:** Implement tools like a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to detect and alert IT security staff of anomalies and security events in real-time. <br> - **Security continuous monitoring:** Utilize network monitoring tools and IT processes to continuously monitor the network for security events, ensuring timely detection and response. <br> - **Detection process:** Employ intrusion detection systems (IDS) and other detection tools to identify security events and suspicious activities, enabling proactive threat mitigation. <br><br> The cybersecurity team could configure source IP address verification on the firewall, analyze spoofed IP addresses using Wireshark or TCPdump on incoming ICMP packets, and implement network monitoring software (SIEM) such as Splunk or LogRhythm to detect abnormal traffic patterns. |
| **Respond**           | - **Planning:** Develop comprehensive action plans to respond to similar attacks in the future, including predefined steps for incident response and escalation procedures. <br> - **Communications:** Establish clear communication channels and protocols to disseminate security event response procedures within the organization, ensuring timely notifications to end users and IT staff affected by the attack. <br> - **Analysis:** Conduct thorough analysis following a similar attack, including examination of network logs and forensic investigation, to identify the attack vectors and improve response strategies. <br> - **Mitigation:** Implement effective response steps to mitigate the impact of an attack, such as isolating affected resources and offlining critical systems to prevent further spread of malicious activities. <br> - **Improvements:** Identify areas for improvement in response procedures, such as enhancing incident reporting mechanisms and updating risk management strategies, to strengthen future response capabilities. <br><br> The cybersecurity team should establish risk management protocols for future security events, serving as a guide for incident response. In the event of an attack, immediate communication with end users will be initiated, followed by containment measures to prevent the spread of malicious files. Critical systems and services will be prioritized for restoration, and network logs will be analyzed for suspicious activity. All incidents will be reported to upper management and legal authorities in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. |

> To address the issue of ICMP flooding and ensure uninterrupted access to network services, the team may deploy a firewall to block ICMP flood attacks. Critical network services should be prioritized for restoration, while non-critical networks can remain offline temporarily. Once the flood of ICMP packets subsides, non-critical network systems and services can be brought back online to resume normal operations.
